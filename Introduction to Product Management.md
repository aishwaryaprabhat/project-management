## What is a Product?
In a software or web app, a feature is typically a product. For example in Facebook the timeline, photos, news feed, ranking, friend list are all products.

In some cases, product managers are not split up by feature but by platform instead. For example, some companies might have a product manager dedicated to the iOS app and another dedicated to the Android app. In this case, the platform is a product.


## Types of Product Managers
Each type differs by stakeholders. Stakeholders are people who have a say/input in the implementation of your product.

### Internal PMs
- They and their teams build internal tools for internal use
- Their stakeholders are the internal users in the company

- Lesser risk since number of users is small

### Consumer PMs

- Nobody tells them what next to build unlike Business PMs
- User tessting, A/B testing
- Uncertainty and pressure 
- Can lose company $

### Business PMs (SaaS PM)
- Builds products for other companies such as Salesforce
- Product Manager interacts a lot with the sales people
- What they build must align with the business requirements
- Good introduction role
- Small number of users, more than internal but less than consumer PM
- Flexible and creative on how you build but not on what you build
- Priorities weighted by $
- Tend to have tight deadlines
